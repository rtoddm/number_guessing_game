## 📖 About
This is a simple browser-based game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number.  
It was one of my first projects using **JavaScript for interactivity** beyond static HTML and CSS.  
While basic, it represents an important step in my learning journey and demonstrates how I started applying logic to enhance user experience.
